ldesc: "Libnice is an implementation of the IETF's draft Interactice 
Connectivity Establishment standard (ICE). It provides GLib-based 
library, libnice and GStreamer elements. ICE is useful for applications 
that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams. It automates the 
process of traversing NATs and provides security against some attacks."
